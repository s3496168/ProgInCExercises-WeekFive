As a mining engineer, I have some knowledge of geology, and can tell you that 
these blocks are so ancient they frighten me. They are mostly sandstone and 
granite, though one is almost certainly made of a queer sort of cement or 
concrete.

They bear evidence of water action, as if this part of the world had been 
submerged and come up again after long ages—all since those blocks were
made and used. It is a matter of hundreds of thousands of years—or heaven
knows how much more. I don't like to think about it.

In view of your previous diligent work in tracking down the legends and 
everything connected with them, I cannot doubt but that you will want to lead 
an expedition to the desert and make some archaeological excavations. Both Dr. 
Boyle and I are prepared to cooperate in such work if you—or organizations
known to you—can furnish the funds.

I can get together a dozen miners for the heavy digging—the blackfellows
would be of no use, for I've found that they have an almost maniacal fear of 
this particular spot. Boyle and I are saying nothing to others, for you very 
obviously ought to have precedence in any discoveries or credit.

The place can be reached from Pilbarra in about four days by motor 
tractor—which we'd need for our apparatus. It is somewhat west and south of 
Warburton's path of 1873, and 100 miles southeast of Joanna Spring. We could 
float things up the De Grey River instead of starting from Pilbarra—but all
that can be talked over later.
